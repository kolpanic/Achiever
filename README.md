###ARE YOU A LEBOWSKI ACHIEVER?

The Achiever screen saver uses your Mac's camera to show your mirror image in the Man of the Year magazine cover, just like The Dude.

1. Move `Achiever.qtz` to `~/Library/Screen Savers/`. If your Library folder is not visible, you can [show it in the Finder](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18928?viewlocale=en_US).
2. Open System Preferences (under the ï£¿ menu). Click on the Desktop & Screen Saver icon, and choose the Screen Saver tab.
3. Select Achiever from the list of available screen savers on the left.
4. Move your mouse over the preview image, and click the Preview button.

You can also use [Hot Corners](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18796?viewlocale=en_US) to activate the screen saver whenever you want, and [Require a Password](http://support.apple.com/kb/PH18669?viewlocale=en_US) to deactivate the screen saver.

It's just a Quartz composition, so It should work with recent versions of OS X. However, your mileage may vary. There are no guarantees.

*The Dude abides.*
